# Optimization Workbook

Welcome to my Data Science project focusing on real-world business applications of mathematical optimization.
Over the coming months, I will explore various optimization techniques and apply them to practical scenarios on this repo.

## Linear Optimization

Linear optimization involves finding the best outcome in a mathematical model whose requirements are represented by linear relationships. Below are some examples from this workbook:

### Problem: Maximize Z = 3x + 4y
**Subject to:** \( x + y \leq 10 \) and \( x, y \geq 0 \)

![Q2 Optimization Plot](images/q2_plot.png "x + y <= 10")

### Problem: Maximize Z = 2x + 3y
**Subject to:** \( x + 2y \leq 8 \) and \( 3x + y \leq 9 \) and \( x, y \geq 0 \)

![Q3 Optimization Plot](images/q3_plot.png "x + 2y < 8 ; 3x + y <= 9")
